### Design data-intensive applications

**Reliability**\
The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even
in the face of adversity (hardware or soft‚Äê ware faults, and even human error).

**Scalability**\
As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with
that growth.

**Maintainability**\
Over time, many different people will work on the system (engineering and operations, both maintaining current
behavior and adapting the system to new use cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.
